WELCOME to the MusicBox! Think of us as sort of an imdb-ish site but for musical artists!  
On our site, you can sign in with a username (create any username you like when you visit for the first time, type it in and click "login") and search for hundreds of artists right at your finger tips.  Learn more about who they are and what they've done and who they sing/perform with! 
Your account will store all of your searches for easier accessibility; no need to re-search for what you've already found!
*REQUIRED: pip install discogs-client otherwise you will not be able to use our service
