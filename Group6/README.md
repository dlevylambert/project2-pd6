<h1>TweetStat</h1>

<b>Description:</br>This application uses the twitter api and various python libraries in order to search tweets from verified celebrity twitter accounts and parse them in order to get stats on them.
<br>
<b>Instructions:</b> Welcome to TweetStat! Simply search the name or twitter username of a famous celebrity (e.g. "Stephen Colbert"), and press "Enter". Statistics will pop up, including the average word count of their tweets and the percentage of words that they spell incorrectly. Have hours of fun comparing President Obama's spelling to Ke$ha's!
