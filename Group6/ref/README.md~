Proposal:
<b> Brian Zhang </b>
Spokeo.com: We use the data generated from this site to collect statistics. Not sure how creative we can get with this, but we may be able to do things like create fake people and stuff.

Cracked.com (or any article-producing site): We use an algorithm for searching through articles and creating a summary of each of them. This is highly algorithm-based, and we may not have the time or knowledge to do something this big, especially since companies pay a lot of money for article-shaving algorithms (There was a 16-year-old student from the UK that created an app for this, and ended up getting millions of dollars in research grants)
