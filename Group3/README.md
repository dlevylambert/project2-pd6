<h1>The Food Finder</h1>

<h2><a href="http://ml7.stuycs.org:6203">The Project</a></h2>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Our application uses the factual restaurant api and the google static maps api. It lets the user select a cuisine (from a list of factual-supported filters) and then returns a maximum of 30 restaurants in the New York City locality that cater to that cuisine.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>Select a cuisine from the menu in the upper left corner of the page, then press the "choose" button. If there are no results, a window will pop up to let you know; otherwise, the page will reload with a new menu in place of the old one. This new menu contains the restaurants of your selected cuisine; choose one and click the "locate restaurant" button, and the page will load a map of your selected restaurant and its location.</p>
<p>If you press the "choose random restaurant" button, a random restaurant and its accompanying map will load onto the page. If you have previously chosen a cuisine before clicking the button, this is taken into account.</p>
<p>Clicking the "back to home" button returns you to the main page with a default map.</p>
