New idea:

User enters Lat. and Long. info. and then using nytimes data we return the elevation, and the nearest populated location. Using google maps, we show it on a map. If it's in the US, we show the zipcode and census information using usatoday.

2nd New Idea:

Games-finding website. Uses APIs from multiple gaming sites (not sure if Wikipedia has an API, might want to use it), takes information like genre and gameplay and gameplay focus and session vs. non-session, etc., and lets people search games of different types. Might want to include finding games based on developer.
