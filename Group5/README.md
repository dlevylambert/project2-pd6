Ideas: We plan on retrieving data from a news site (possibly USA today or another national newspaper) and then analyzing the articles to find out 
the location being referred to. We would then plot these locations on a map. This can be used to determine if there is media bias, or if one part
of the country has events happening. We might be able to use a Google Maps Api for this. We would generate different maps depending on article topic. 


API's:

News:
NYTimes has a geo API which gives the Lat. and Lon. of stuff that happened. This would make it quite easy to use with google maps.
