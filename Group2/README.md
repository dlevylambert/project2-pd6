1.NAME: The Movie Recommender
2.The Movie recommender does a few things, but the first is that it asks you to choose a method to find movies. You may either type in a keyword of a movie (or a movie name) and search based on that, or based on a genre from a list of genres provided, look for the upcoming movies, the ones in theaters now, or the popular ones (according to the movie DB). 
Then, you are directed to a searchresult page, with the results based on your search. You are presented with a dropdown menu from which you pick the movie you are looking for (as some categories/key words have multiple movies associated with them).
After picking one, on the same page, thanks to the magic of Javascript, things relating to the movie appear, such as its genre, cast, title, release date, and coolest of all: its trailer (if existant) and its NYT review (if existant). 
You are also given a dropdown menu of "similar" movies, from which you can choose. If you choose one, its information will replace that of the movie you were looking at before, again, without redirecting, and using the magic of javascript.
There is also a back button to go back to the search page.
3. It will be hosted on http://ml7.stuycs.org:6202
4.You use the project as described in step 2.
