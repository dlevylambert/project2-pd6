NYC Events is a space that consolidates a list of public events in the boroughs of New York City through the NYC Open Data API. NYC Events makes it easy to see what New Yorkers are doing and where events are hosted. It even displays future events.

To use NYC Events, select a borough and date in 2012 or 2013. All public events on NYC Open Data hosted in the borough this year and next will appear. Events are color coordinated according to the selected date. If an event is on the day selected, it will be displayed at the top of the screen in red. To see more information on an event, users may click on event titles to be redirected to a Google search of the event.
