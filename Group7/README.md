Current Idea:

We will be using the BeThereNYC api to find upcoming street activities and placing them on google calendar for convenience. We might also provide a map and use google directions. (BeThereNYC seems to be down right now, but it was working this afternoon 11/16...)

Other Idea:

We will be using the New York Art Beat API to find upcoming art events (galleries, films, performances, competitions, etc.) and place them on a google calendar for convenience. We might also provide a map and use google directions.

Old Ideas:

Using NYC open data to find upcoming street activities and placing them on a Google calendar for convenience. We could also provide a map and use the Google directions feature.
