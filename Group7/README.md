Current Idea:

We will be using the BeThereNYC api to find upcoming street activities and placing them on google calendar for convenience. We might also provide a map and use google directions. (BeThereNYC seems to be down right now, but it was working this afternoon 11/16...)

Other Idea:

We will be using the New York Art Beat API to find upcoming art events (galleries, films, performances, competitions, etc.) and place them on a google calendar for convenience. We might also provide a map and use google directions.

Old Ideas:

Using NYC open data to find upcoming street activities and placing them on a Google calendar for convenience. We could also provide a map and use the Google directions feature. 

We are also looking into ways to collect data about celebrity visits to NYC. If we find this, we will use this data instead of street activities.
