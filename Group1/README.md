Use the NYC high schools API that we looked at briefly in class to create a program where a person could be matched with a high school based on a number of factors that they input. I.e they would specify how they value distance, quality of school (SAT scores), diversity, size etc. and the program would return a list of compatible schools by analyzing with the the API info. For the location parameter, we can try to incorporate the google maps API to measure commute time between locations.
